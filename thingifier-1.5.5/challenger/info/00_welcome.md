## Welcome to the API Challenges

Welcome to the API Challenges.

A learning environment to experiment, explore, and play with API Testing.

In this video I will quickly give you an overview of the features and how to use the API Challenges.

## API Challenges GUI

[show main index page, click on to entities explorer, and click through]

You can see we have a GUI, with instructions, and we can view all the data in the system.

The GUI is read only, because the main purpose is to explore the API for this application.

## API Documentation

[show documentation]

The API is documented, listing the API End points and showing sample data.

But like all API documentation we have to understand how APIs work to make sense of it, but the documentation does show the URIs we can call, the methods we can use, and the data formats used.

## The Challenges

[show challenges]

We also have challenges. To help guide you through the process of exploring and experimenting with the API we have a set of challenges that you can try. This helps gamify the learning experience and you can see the progress you are making as you complete each challenge.

## Multi-User

This is a multi-user application. That means:

- other people are using the same data
- so don't add any secret data
- don't use this to store any personal todo items
- and be considerate of other users, so only add family friendly text into the system

We want this tool to be easily available to as many people to learn from as possible, but if the system is abused then we may have to revisit these policies.

Also, because it is multi-user the system data resets itself every 10 minutes.

## The API

The API is accessible through normal API calls, and you probably want to use a standard API front end to interact with it.

I tend to use Insomnia, PAW or PostMan but any API Front end should work.

I can make API calls to the system to create and amend data.

And if these calls are successful then I will see the results in the Entities Explorer view of the application as well.

The API Documentation should give you the information you need to use the API.

## The Challenges

[show the challenges list]

The challenges are a list of things to do with the API.

And if you have downloaded the application and are running it locally then your progress against these challenges will be automatically tracked.

If you are using the cloud hosted multi-user version, then you'll have to register a challenger session, and your challenge completion status will be stored on the cloud so you can revisit it.

## What Next?

That was just a quick overview.

You can find more information at [eviltester.com/apichallenges](https://eviltester.com/apichallenges).

Including download links and instructions to use the application locally on your machine without any interaction with other people, and this makes it easier to do the challenges.

And there will be more information and examples of how to use the challenges and register as a challenger to track your progress.

So, now, explore the site. Read the documentation. Experiment with the API. And practice your API Testing.

This project has Automated Execution for helping test it.

- 20180728 I have created a set of tactical Java JUnit @Test methods which use [RestAssured](http://rest-assured.io/) to replicate the [Postman Workspace](https://github.com/eviltester/thingifier/blob/master/docs/rest_testing/TodoManagerThingifier.postman_collection.json) Automated collection runner

These are 'tactical' i.e. they get the job done, but long term would expose me to quite a lot of maintenance and have a lot of code duplication, there are no real abstraction layers specific to the application.

**If you are interested in this, then you might be interested in my book [Automating and Testing a REST API](https://www.compendiumdev.co.uk/page/tracksrestapibook)**
